What is ponicode ?

This is an AI tool for auto generation of unit test cases for your code.

How to set up ?

You can directly use this inside VS code as installing dependency from extensions tab or from microsoft vscode website (link added in references)
For vsCode check below icon from the extension tab.




How to use it with JS code ?

With JS code as i tested no need to update any special dependency , you can directly use this by just adding vsCode extension



How to use TS(Typescript) code ?

With TS code you needs to install some additional npm dependencies , check package.json .



My Thoughts

1) This tool is great for add unit test cases for less complex code
2) Developer can use this tool for finding multiple example/scenarios for his unit test cases , as Ponicode separate option to generate inputs or scenarios for unit test cases
3) This tool needs to improve a lot for complex code , like DB repositories function unit test  cases .
4) As i gone through expert blog mentioned below , this tool needs improve a lot 
5) Behind the scenes for js or ts as I understand it uses JEST (for javascript), developers also quickly understand Jest and write its unit test cases.
